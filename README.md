# TDS-Project-1

### README

- We scraped user and repository data for GitHub users in Seattle with more than 200 followers using the GitHub API.
- One surprising insight is that users with hireable profiles tend to follow significantly more people than those who are not hireable.
- Developers should consider enabling both wikis and projects together, as these are often correlated and can increase engagement.

### Project Structure:
- `users.csv`: Contains information about users in Seattle with over 200 followers.
- `repositories.csv`: Contains the details of repositories owned by these users.
